// package forms is a lightweight, but incredibly useful library for parsing
// form data from an http.Request. It supports multipart forms, url-encoded
// forms, json data, and url query parameters. It also provides helper methods
// for converting data into other types and a Validator object which can be
// used to validate the data. Forms is framework-agnostic and works directly
// with the http package.
